# Intervals
## A music interval trainer
Bash script that plays a musical interval then says the name of the interval.

Optionally says the name of a song that uses that interval prominently.

## Dependencies
Requires a `say` command to output the name of the interval.

Requires an `open` command to play an OGG file.

Both commands are installed on OS X by default.
